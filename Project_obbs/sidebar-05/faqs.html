                      <li>The procedure, which is performed by a trained, skilled health-care professional, takes approximately 30 minutes. You will give about 450 ml of blood, after which you will be advised to remain on the donor bed for a few minutes longer and then to take some refreshments. Plan to spend about half an hour to an hour at the blood donor centre for the entire process, depending on the size of the centre and the number of donors.</li>

                      <li>You may donate either whole blood or a specific blood component such as blood platelets. Each type of donation requires a certain waiting period before you can give again. 
					  After a whole blood donation, a person must wait at least 56 days before donating again.</li>
					  <li>The minimum interval between whole blood donations is 12 weeks for men and 16 weeks for women. 
					  Platelet and plasma donors are able to donate more frequently.

                    <p>Before donating blood, please follow these steps:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Eat at your regular mealtimes and drink plenty of fluid before you donate blood. Have a snack at least four hours before you donate, but do not eat too much right before the donation.</li>
                      <li>Before you leave the blood donor clinic after your blood donation, have some tea, coffee or a soft drink to help replace the blood volume (approximately 450 ml) which has been reduced as a result of your donation.</li>
                      <li>Avoid taking aspirin or aspirin-like anti-inflammatory medication in the 72 hours prior to your donation, because aspirin inhibits the function of blood platelets. If you have taken aspirin within this period, your blood platelet component cannot be transfused to a patient.</li>
